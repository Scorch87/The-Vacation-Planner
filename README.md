# <The Vacation Planner>

## Description

Planning a vacation can be a hassle- The Vacation Planner allows a user to:
Find a destination & visualize it on a map 	‚úà
Select dates of travel 	üìÖ
View weather forecasts and weather history for the selected travel dates ‚õà
So, in other words: Vacations simplified!

- What was your motivation?
We wanted to enable users to quickly plan a simple trip- the inspiration came from our very own Matin who was traveling back from Costa Rica as we came up with ideas.

- What problem does it solve?
The Vacation Planner solves the headache of having to use multiple websites to pull up the most important elements of travel: location, date, and weather.

- What did you learn?

Technologies Used: Bulma, HERE Maps API, Google Maps API
Breakdown of Tasks: 
Eli - Map API, implementing the map and searching for locations
Connor - Weather API, implementing weather queries
Steven - Front end
Matin - Front end
Challenges: 
Learning Bulma 
complexity with the HERE platform - not just one simple API call, but multiple calls to multiple different APIs
API security credentials
CORS errors 
Teammate challenges
Successes: Getting Google maps to function, implementing search and geocoding. Discovered local development server. Using Bulma for front end. Github practice & workflow.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
