# <The Vacation Planner>

## Description

Planning a vacation can be a hassle- The Vacation Planner allows a user to:
Find a destination & visualize it on a map 	âœˆ
Select dates of travel 	ðŸ“…
View weather forecasts and weather history for the selected travel dates â›ˆ
So, in other words: Vacations simplified!

- What was your motivation?
We wanted to enable users to quickly plan a simple trip- the inspiration came from our very own Matin who was traveling back from Costa Rica as we came up with ideas.

- What problem does it solve?
The Vacation Planner solves the headache of having to use multiple websites to pull up the most important elements of travel: location, date, and weather.
